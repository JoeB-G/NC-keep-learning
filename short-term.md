# Short-term coding projects

The short term of your post-graduate life will be mostly spent spiking in preparation for your medium/long term projects. Those sections can follow whatever has been covered on the course to grasp any concept a bit better or to discover something new. You may want to choose some of what is following based on your personal preferences or to get more prepared for a specific role you are interested in.

Those are only suggestions and cover some of the material you may want to look at, there is lots of more material to go deeper to get more knowledge in the specific topic using Google, don't be afraid to go to the second page too!

## **NC Notes**

[NC Notes](https://notes.northcoders.com/courses) are a great place to start if you want to have a second look at the material covered in the course. Remember; online, official documentation is something you'll always want to look at to get more detailed info. Whit those you can jump in any JS project you want to add to your CV/Portfolio.
