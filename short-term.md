# Short-term coding projects
---

This section of the repo is mainly for spiking new tech in preparation for your medium/long term projects. You can choose to follow on from content covered on the course to fully grasp a concept or choose to discover something new. You may want to learn more about a tech which particularly interests you or look at a new tech-stack to get prepared for a specific role.

Below are some suggestions that cover some of the material you may want to look at...

## **NC Notes**

[NC Notes](https://notes.northcoders.com/courses) are a great place to start if you want to have a second look at the content covered in the course. The notes and W3Schools are a great if you need to re-learn anything or if you simply need reference material then remember our old friend: The Docs!

## **New Technologies**

### **React-Native**

Is the good old React you know, but made native for mobile, multi-platform development! It's definately worth a look and quite straightforward to pick up as it shares the majority of syntax with React.
