# Front End Tech Tests

## Instructions:

This repo is built to help you prepare for any Front End Tech Tests you meet in the future.

The best way to work with this repo is to get it running on your local host and then solve the challenges in a seperate react app.

The script to build a new react app is

```bash
npx create-react-app [NAME_HERE]
```

The instructions for each test are included on the locally hosted version of this repo!

## Setting Up:

In your terminal, run the script

```bash
npm install
```

Next, open this repo by running the script

```bash
npm start
```

You're ready to get started on the tech tests!
