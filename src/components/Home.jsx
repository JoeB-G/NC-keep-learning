      <h2>Welcome to the Front-End Tech Tests!</h2>
      <p>
        This is the repo where you can hone your skills and sharpen your teeth
        on some problems you might face in an interview
      </p>
      <p>
        We have given you 6 challenges that you can try. We suggest you build a
        new React App to try addressing these problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each test demonstrates how the solution should function, how you build
        it is up to you, but it must have the core functionality that has been
        asked for!
      </p>
      <p>In order, the tests are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Build a Log-in Page,</li>
        <li>Build a Movie Search Bar,</li>
        <li>Create a "Name the 50 US States" Game,</li>
        <li>Create a "Find the X" Game,</li>
        <li>Build a Drop-Down Menu,</li>
        <li>Build a Pseudo Instant Messaging Service</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you feel comfortable enough, try implementing the challenge section
        of each test!
      </p>
      <p>They're harder than they appear...</p>
      <p>Have fun, and best of luck in your interviews!</p>
