# 6. Convert To Roman Numerals
This is one that I used to hear about from candidates when I used to be a Tech Recruiter! I thought we should tackle this so we're better prepared for it if we ever face it in a real life tech test!

If you need a reminder the Roman Numerals we'll be using are as follows:

1: I,
5: V,
10: X,
50: L,
100: C,
500: D,
1,000: M

We won't be interested in any Roman Numeral over 4,999 as the rules change once we hit 5,000.

## Task:
Create a function that receives an integer between 1 and 4,999 which will then convert it into its Roman Numeral counterpart.
