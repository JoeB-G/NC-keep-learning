# Back End Tech Tests!

Welcome to the tech test repo!

## Set Up:

This is vital stuff!

First, you are going to need to install all the dependencies that are associated with this repo. Run these scripts:

```http
cd be_tech_tests
npm install
```

Lastly, make sure you update your test script with "jest" in the package.json.

This should mean you're ready to go!


## Structure:

There are 4 main directories filled with tech tests for you.

1. Intermediate Challenges

These are to get you into the groove for the later ones that come. They are what you are most likely to face in a tech test and should leave you scratching your head for a little bit as you get the tests to work.

2. Class Challenges

Sometimes, you'll be asked to use OOP to solve a problem instead of FP... These are here to help you get back on top of OOP so you can smash through that curveball you might face.

This will also introduce a couple of new concepts to you... Why? Well, if you meet something unfamiliar in a tech test, you'll be expected to research!

3. Big O Notation & Time Complexity

Delving a bit into Computer Science here. These tests are to get you familiar with an important concept in programming.

Building efficient algorithms.

The way you may first solve a problem might not be scalable, and if you have your eyes set on top companies, knowing how to shrink the time it takes to get an answer is an invalualbe skill.

You aren't left blind though, there are a few links for you to investigate to help you!

4. Advanced

Are you up for a challenge?

These are 4 functions that should make you utilise all the skills you've used so far. They might seem simple at first, but each one has a little twist that you will need to consider before you can solve it

Inside each Challenge directory will be instructions on the tech test, a test file, a function file and a solution file.

I strongly recommend completing the challenges without looking at the solution. They are there to help you compare your solution against mine and to show you that the tests will pass, if needed.
