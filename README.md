# Northcoders Postgrad Repo

---

Welcome to the Northcoders Postgrad Repo and to your new life as a fully-fledged Northcoder!

---

## The Northcoders course has finished. What do I do now?...

We are aware that following on from the intense and wonderful learning experience at Northcoders, many graduates are faced with the difficult task of filling the gap it leaves behind. But how do you decide what to work on next in order to add to your portfolio and keep your coding muscles toned? Well, fear not, this repo is here to guide you...

## Where should I start?

Ahead of anything else, we'd recommend getting your portfolio website working and ready to house all of your work. This will be a really powerful tool to demonstrate what you're capable of and grab the attention of potential employers, so put some love into it. Once your portfolio site is ready, you can get going on some lovely projects to populate it with.
This repo contains suggestions for project ideas and has three project sections: pick a suitable project based on your experience level and available time. Also try out the tech-tests section which aims to replicate some of the challenges you may face in interview tech tests.

---

### **Short term**

These projects should take less than a day to complete and are largely useful for spiking out new libraries/frameworks.

### **Medium term**

These projects should take 1-4 days to complete, they will be useful for small portfolio pieces and are probably best suited to complete with a library/framework with which you have some familiarity.

### **Long term**

These full-stack projects should take more than one week to complete and will make for excellent, larger portfolio pieces. It should be possible to complete these projects utilising the technologies you've learned during your time at Northcoders, though venturing into alternative technologies is warmly welcomed.

## Tech Test Set-Up:

If you wish to use the either the Front-End or Back-End Tech Tests you'll need to run the following bash script in your terminal, whilst located in the root directory of this repository.

```bash
npm install
```

### **Back end tech tests**

If you get an interview, there's a good chance you will have to complete a tech test. Whether on your own or with someone else, this is your chance to shine. These Challenges are designed to get you ready for your next tech test so you ace it.

**PLEASE NOTE**: This is a living repository which will be updated regularly. The tech-challenges available at the moment are quite maths-heavy and also the difficulty elevates rapidly; some of these challenges are quite tricky! As such, this section only represents a small percentage of possible tech tests you could face right now. Stay tuned for regular updates ðŸš€

### **Front-end tech tests**

If you're wanting a Front-End Developer position, you'll still come across tech tests. These tests will be more focussed on how well you work with front-end technologies.

Run the following script:

```bash
npm start
```

This will show you the tech tests available to you with some instructions on each one. Have fun!

**Make sure to read the START_HERE.md file in the src/ directory before attempting the tech test section, it contains some valuable information before you get started.**
