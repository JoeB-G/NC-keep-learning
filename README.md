# Northcoders Postgrad Repo

Welcome to the Northcoders Postgrad Repo - and your new life as a fully-fledged Northcoder!

## The Northcoders course has finished. What do I do now?...

We are aware that, following on from the intense and wonderful learning experience at Northcoders, many graduates are faced with the difficult task of filling the gap left behind. But how do you go about deciding what to work on next in order to to add to your portfolio and keep your coding muscles toned? Well fear not...

This repo contains suggestions for project ideas and has three sections:

### **Short term**

These projects should take less than a day to complete and are largely useful for spiking out new libraries/frameworks.

### **Medium term**

These projects should take 1-4 days to complete, they will be useful for small portfolio pieces and are probably best suited to complete with a library/framework with which you have some familiarity.

### **Long term**

These full-stack projects should take more than one week to complete and will make for excellent, larger portfolio pieces. It should be possible to complete these projects utilising the technologies you've learned during your time at Northcoders - though venturing into alternative technologies is warmly welcomed.

## Where should I start?

First of all, we would recommend getting your portfolio website working and ready to house all of the projects you complete. Once the portfolio site is ready, pick the right project based on your experience level and available time...
