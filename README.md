# Northcoders Postgrad Repo

---

Welcome to the Northcoders Postgrad Repo - and to your new life as a fully-fledged Northcoder!

## Set Up:

If you wish to use the either the Front End or Back End Tech Tests you'll need to run the following bash script in your terminal, whilst you are located in the root directory of this repository.

```bash
npm install
```

When you get to the relevant section of the repo you can use the mentioned scripts as you want.

## The Northcoders course has finished. What do I do now?...

We are aware that, following on from the intense and wonderful learning experience at Northcoders, many graduates are faced with the difficult task of filling the gap it leaves behind. But how do you decide what to work on next in order to add to your portfolio and keep your coding muscles toned? Well, fear not, this repo is here to guide you...

## Where should I start?

Ahead of anything else, we'd recommend getting your portfolio website working and ready to house all of your work. This will be a really powerful tool to demonstrate what you're capable of and grab the attention of potential employers - so put some love into it. Once your portfolio site is ready, you can get going on some lovely projects to populate it with.
This repo contains suggestions for project ideas and has three sections: pick a suitable project based on your experience level and available time.

### **Short term**

These projects should take less than a day to complete and are largely useful for spiking out new libraries/frameworks.

### **Medium term**

These projects should take 1-4 days to complete, they will be useful for small portfolio pieces and are probably best suited to complete with a library/framework with which you have some familiarity.

### **Long term**

These full-stack projects should take more than one week to complete and will make for excellent, larger portfolio pieces. It should be possible to complete these projects utilising the technologies you've learned during your time at Northcoders - though venturing into alternative technologies is warmly welcomed.

### **Back end tech tests**

If you get an interview, you'll no doubt be told that you will have to complete a tech test. Whether on your own or with someone else, it can make or break your chances.

These 20 Challenges are designed to get you ready for your next tech test so you ace it.

Make sure to read the **START_HERE** file before delving in, it contains some valuable information before you get started.

### **Front end tech tests**

If you're wanting a Front End Developer position, you'll still come across tech tests. But, these are to see how well you work with front end technologies instead of your problem solving acumen.

You can check out the START_HERE.md file in the src/ directory, or...

Run the following script:

```bash
npm start
```

This will show you the tech tests available to you with some instructions on each one. Have fun!
