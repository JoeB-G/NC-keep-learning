# 5. Special Pythagorean Triplet
## Free Code Camp <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/project-euler/problem-9-special-pythagorean-triplet">link</a>
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 , 5, ...), a < b < c, for which,
a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>.

For example, 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5<sup>2</sup>.

When we sum a and b and c we derive a new number. Some of these numbers can only be made by one set of Pythagorean triplets.

For example, there exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.

## Task:
We want to find a special Pythagorean triplet which sums to some desired number, n. When we have a + b + c, we want to find the number that is the product of these three, a*b*c.

Write a function that will allow us to find out this product abc.
